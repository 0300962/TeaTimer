# TeaTimer
Push a button to remember when your tea was brewed. Simple!

Written for a Pimoroni Badger2040, with an RV3028 RTC board connected via I2C (on the QW/ST connector on the back of the Badger), and a couple of AAA batteries.

Notes - 
1. I'm not a python programmer so sorry about that.
2. The teapot body took about 13.5hrs to print on an Ender-3 set to max layer height.  Support is needed; make sure to remove the internal section carefully, you'll need that space for the lever.
3. The lever just sits in the recess inside the teapot and is held in place by the Badger (the 'up' and 'down' buttons go at the top). Print this at a higher resolution and make sure your layers are running lengthways or it may snap. When you press the lever vertically it deforms slightly to press the middle button on the Badger.
4. The thing sticking out of the 'spring' is there to guide the lever, you may want to scale the spring up a couple of percent to keep the Badger secure (or use 2 springs). You'll need to snip a little off of the top of the lever so that the lid sits at a nice height once it's all printed.
